it really is depicted well in the model photo, although i think it may be cut somewhat shorter than it appears in the photo. i am 5'9"" and its shorter on me than on the model who, i imagine, is taller than me.
the dress is made of a substantial, tight knit material. i found it to be a bit boxy so i washed and tumble dried it, hoping to tighten it up a bit. t",1,2,General Petite,Dresses,Dresses,4

i ordered the nude after debating, but glad i did, it is a bit warmer in color, and i need warm colors to complement my pale skin. teh nude almost has a slight pink hue to it (maybe i am seeing things). it is soft, not sure there is wool, i am not that sensitive to wool, felt soft to me.

cons: the fabric is stiffer than i was expecting, and the blouse cuts in under the arms. (i don't mean that it is tight or digs in, but it cuts in; you can't tell in the angle of the photo.) the blouse is short as well, and, as i am curvy, it really stuck out all around at the waist. worth trying on if you have a straighter figure.",0,5,General,Tops,Blouses,3

fyi: 36c, broad shoulders/back, short waist - normally i wear a m in c&s, and that is what i tried in this halter top.
oddly the overall length was okay, but the armholes were very low. in the m, the bust area was tighter than it should have been for a easy summer top. i think that this is due to the overall length of the bodice. in other words, the top ha",1,7,General Petite,Tops,Blouses,4
